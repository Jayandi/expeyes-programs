      This package provides a set of example programs to drive an ATmega32 microcontroller, together with a tutorial explaining how to compile them, upload them to the microcontroller, and how to make simple and more complicated modifications. It is meant to be used with the &quot;microhope&quot; board which makes it easy to upload code to the microcontroller through a USB link.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to examples there is a library to drive all of the peripherals available on the &quot;microhope&quot; board: LED, LCD display, ADC connected to sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Graphic User Interface is provided too.
