<h1>Stroboscope</h1>
<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p>Observation of a periodic phenomenon with a periodic flashed light.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/stroboscope.svg"><img alt="_images/stroboscope.svg" src="_images/stroboscope.svg" width="300px"/></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The disk is rotated by powering the motor by a 1.5 V cell.</li>
<li>The disk is illuminated with light from the LED only, no other light
should be present.</li>
<li>Adjust the frequency of SQ1, the disk will appear stationary when it
is equal to the frequency of rotation of the disk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the frequency of the phenomenon under observation and the frequency
of the flashing light are matching, one can see a still image.</p>
<p>What happens when the frequency of the light is slightly increased, or slightly
decreased?</p>
<p>What happens when the frequency of the flasing light is twice the frequency
of the phenomenon? and when it is the half of its value?</p>
