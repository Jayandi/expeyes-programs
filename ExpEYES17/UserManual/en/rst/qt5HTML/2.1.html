<h1>Measuring Voltage</h1>
<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p>Learn to measure voltage using expEYES and get some idea about the
concept of Electrical Ground. A dry-cell and two wires are required.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/measure-dc.svg"><img alt="_images/measure-dc.svg" src="_images/measure-dc.svg" width="300px"/></a>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Observe the voltage at A1 displayed.</li>
<li>Repeat by reversing the cell connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Voltages measured value is +1.5 volts and it becomes -1.5 after
reversing the connections.</p>
<p>We are measuring the potential difference between two points. One of
them can be treated as at zero volts, or Ground potential. The voltage
measuring points of expEYES measure the voltage with respect to the
terminals marked GND. We have connected the negative terminal of the
cell to Ground. The positive terminal is at +1.5 volts with respect to
the negative terminal. <em>Will it show correct voltage if GND is not
connected ?</em></p>
