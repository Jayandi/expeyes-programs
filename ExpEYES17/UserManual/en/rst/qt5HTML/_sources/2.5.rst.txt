Direct and Alternating Currents
===============================

**Objective**

Introduce the concept of time dependent voltages, using a V(t) graph.
Compare the graph of DC and AC.

**Procedure**

-  Set PV1 to 2 volts and Set WG to 200 Hz
-  Enable analyse on A1, to measure amplitude and frequency.
-  Enable A2

**Discussion**

In the plot if voltage is not changing, it is pure DC. If the voltage is
changing with time, it has an AC component. if the average voltage is
zero, it is pure DC. In the second plot, the voltage is changing from
zero to file volts, is it AC, DC or something else ???
