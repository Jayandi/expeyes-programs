Transistor Output characteristics (CE)
======================================

**Objective**

Plot the output characteristic curve of a transistor. Collector is
connected to PV1 through a 1K resistor.

**Procedure**

-  Set base voltage to the 1 volt and START.
-  Repeat for different base currents.

**Discussion**

The characteristic curves for different base currents are shown in
figure. The collector current is obtained from the voltage difference
across the :math:`1~k\Omega` resistor.

The base current is set by setting the voltage at one end of the :math:`100~k\Omega`
resistor, the other end is connected to the transistor base. The value
of base current is calculated by,
:math:`I_b = (U_{PV2} − U_{A2})/(100 \times 10^3) \times 10^6~\mu A`.
If A2 is not connected, the code assumes 0.6 volts at the base to
calculate the base current.
