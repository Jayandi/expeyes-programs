<h1>The main GUI program</h1>
<p>Start Applications-&gt;Education-&gt;ExpEYES-17 from the menu. A four channel
oscilloscope screen with several extra features will open as shown in
figure <a class="reference internal" href="#the-scope17-screen"><span class="std std-ref">The scope17 screen showing two traces</span></a>. Various experiments can be
selected from the menu.</p>

<p>The main window looks like a low frequency four channel oscilloscope,
with some extra features, on the right side panel. Applications for
various experiments can be selected from the pulldown menu. A brief
description of the oscilloscope program is given below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Any of the four inputs (A1, A2, A3 or MIC) can be enabled using the
corresponding checkbox. The input range can be selected by clicking
on the menubutton on the right side of the checkbox. Select the
desired input range from the popup menu.</li>
<li>There is another checkbox, to enable mathematical fitting of the data
using V = V0sin(2πft + θ) + C to show the amplitude and
frequency.</li>
<li>The horizontal scale (time base) can be changed by a slider, from .5
mS fullscale to 500 mS full scale.</li>
<li>The Checkbutton <strong>Freeze</strong>, allows to pause and resume the
oscilloscope operation.</li>
<li>The Trigger level can be set by a slider, and there is a menubutton
to select the trigger source.</li>
<li>To save the traces to a file, edit the filename and click on the
<strong>SaveTo</strong> button.</li>
<li>Clicking on <strong>FFT</strong> shows the frequency spectrum of all the eneabled
channels, appears on popup windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Oscilloscope, there are several measurement/control
options available on the GUI, they are explained below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If selected, the voltages at the inputs A1, A2 and A3 are sampled
every second and displayed.</li>
<li>The resistance connected between SEN and Ground is measured and
displayed every second.</li>
<li>Clicking <strong>Capacitance on IN1</strong>, measures the value of the capacitor
connected between IN1 and GND.</li>
<li>Clicking <strong>Frequency on IN2</strong>, measures the frequency of an external
digital (TTL standard) pulse connected to IN2</li>
<li>The shape of the waveform can be selected using the menubutton,
default shape is sine. It can be changed to triangular. When the
square wave option is selected, the output is shifted to SQ2. You
cannot have sine/triangular and SQ2 at the same time.</li>
<li>Frequency of the Waveform generator WG can be set using the slider or
the text entry window. The two input methods follow each other,
changing the slider will change the text field and entering data
using text field will set the slider to that value. The frequency
will be set to the nearest possible value and it will be displayed in
the message window at the bottom. The amplitude of WG output can be
set to 3 volts, 1 volt or 80 mV.</li>
<li>SQ1 can be set using the same method as explained above. The duty
cycle can be set between 1% to 99%, default is 50%.</li>
<li>The programmable volages PV1 and PV2 are also set in a similar
manner.</li>
<li>Checkbuttons are provided to control OD1 and CCS.</li>
</ul>
