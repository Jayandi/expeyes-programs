<h1>AC Transformer</h1>
<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p>Demonstrate mutual induction using two coils, supplied with ExpEYES. One
coil, the primary, is connected between WG and Ground. The axes of the
coils are aligned and a ferrite core is inserted.begin_inset Separator

<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make connections as shown in the figure</p></li>
<li><p>Enable A1 and A2</p></li>
<li><p>Set WG to 500 Hz</p></li>
<li><p>Bring the coils close and watch the voltage on A2.</p></li>
<li><p>Try inserting an ion core</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The applied waveform and the induced waveform are shown in figure. A
changing magnetic filed is causing the induced voltage. In the previous
two experiments, the changing magnetic field was created by the movement
of permanent magnets. In the present case the changing magnetic field is
created by a time varying current.</p>
<p>Try doing this experiment using a squarewave. Connect a 1kÎ© resistor
across secondary coil to reduce ringing.</p>
<p>The concept of Alternating Current is introduced by plotting the voltage
as a function of time. The behavior of circuits elements like capacitors
and inductors in AC and DC circuits are explored, by measuring
parameters like amplitude, frequency and phase. Converting electrical
signals into sound and back is demonstrated.</p>
<p>For each experiment, make connections as per the diagram given.</p>
