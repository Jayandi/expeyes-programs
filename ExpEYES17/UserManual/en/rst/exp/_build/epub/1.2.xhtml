<h1>The equipment</h1>
<p>ExpEYES-17 is interfaced and powered by the USB port of the computer,
and it is programmable in Python. It can function as a low frequency
oscilloscope, function generator, programmable voltage source, frequency
counter and data logger. For connecting external signals, it has two
spring loaded terminals blocks, one for output signals and another for
inputs, as shown in figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig-The-ExpEYES-toppanel">1.1↓</a>. The
software can monitor and control the voltages at these terminals. In
order to measure other parameters (like temperature, pressure etc.), we
need to convert them in to electrical signals by using appropriate
sensor elements. The accuracy of the voltage measurements is decided by
the stability of the 3.3V reference used, it is 50ppm per degree
celcius. The gain and offset errors are eliminated by initial
calibration, using a 16bit ADC. Even though our primary objective is to
do experiments, you are advised to read through the brief description of
the equipment given below. The device can be also used as a test
equipment for electrical and electronics engineering experiments.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT :</em></p>
<p><em>The external voltages connected to ExpEYES17 must be within the allowed
limits. Inputs A1 and A2 must be within ±16 volts range and Inputs IN1
and IN2 must be in 0 to 3.3V range. Exceeding these limits may result in
damage to the equipment. To measure higher voltages, scale them down
using resistive potential divider networks.</em></p>

<h2>External connections</h2>
<p>The functions of the external connections briefly explained below. All
the black coulored terminals are at ground potential, all other voltages
are measured with respect to it.</p>
<div class="section" id="outputs">
<h3>Outputs:</h3>
<div class="section" id="constant-current-source-ccs">
<h4>Constant Current Source (CCS) :</h4>
<p>The constant current source can be switched ON and OFF under software
control. The nominal value is 1.1 mA but may vary from unit to unit, due
to component tolerances. To measure the exact value, connect an ammeter
from CCS to GND. Another method is to connect a known resistance (~1k)
and measure the voltage drop across it. The load resistor should be less
than 3k for this current source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="programmable-voltage-pv1">
<h4>Programmable Voltage (PV1) :</h4>
<p>Can be set, from software, to any value in the -5V to +5V range. The
resolution is 12 bits, implies a minimum voltage step of around 2.5
millivolts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="programmable-voltage-pv2">
<h4>Programmable Voltage (PV2) :</h4>
<p>Can be set, from software, to any value in the -3.3V to +3.3V range. The
resolution is 12 bits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="square-wave-sq1">
<h4>Square Wave SQ1:</h4>
<p>Output swings from 0 to 5 volts and frequency can be varied 4Hz to
100kHz. All intermediate values of frequency are not possible. The duty
cycle of the output is programmable. Setting frequency to 0Hz will make
the output HIGH and setting it to  − 1 will make it LOW, in both cases
the wave generation is disabled. SQR1 output has a <img class="math" src="_images/math/36dfc0dd6f490d35fa65c29d9013ee762dc718f1.png" alt="100~\Omega"/> <strong>series
resistor</strong> inside so that it can drive LEDs directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="square-wave-sq2">
<h4>Square Wave SQ2:</h4>
<p>Output swings from 0 to 5 volts and frequency can be varied 4Hz to
100kHz. All intermediate values of frequency are not possible. The duty
cycle of the output is programmable. SQR2 is not available when WG is
active.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digital-output-od1">
<h4>Digital Output (OD1) :</h4>
<p>The voltage at OD1 can be set to 0 or 5 volts, using software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sine-triangular-wave-wg">
<h4>Sine/Triangular Wave WG:</h4>
<p>Frequency can be varied from 5Hz to 5kHz. The peak value of the
amplitude can be set to 3 volts, 1.0 volt or 80 mV. Shape of the output
waveform is programmable. Using the GUI sine or triangular can be
selected. WG bar is inverted WG.</p>

<h4>Capacitance meter IN1:</h4>
<p>Capacitance connected between IN1 and Ground can be measured. It works
better for lower capacitance values, upto 10 nanoFarads, results may not
be very accurate beyond that.</p>

Thermistor, Photo-transistor etc. SEN is internally connected to 3.3
volts through a 5.1kΩ resistor.</p>

amplified by connecting a resistor from Rg to Ground, gain
=1 + (Rg)/(10000). This enables displaying very small amplitude signals.
