<h1>Getting Familiar with ExpEYES17</h1>
<p>Before proceeding with the experiments, let us do some simple exercises
to become familiar with expEYES-17. Connect the device a USB port and
start the ExpEYES-17 program from the menu ’Applications-&gt;Education’.
Enable the ’Popup Help’ option and select the first few items from the
school menu.</p>
<p>The following chapters are organized according to the pulldown menus of
the eyes17 program, each chapter containing the experiments under the
corresponding menu; like School level, Eelectronics, Eelectrical etc. To
perform the expeiment, select it from the menu. Online help is available
for every experiment, making this manual almost redundant.</p>
<p>The screen shots given in this document are not from the GUI program,
because the black background images are difficult to print. The plots
are generated by separate code.</p>
