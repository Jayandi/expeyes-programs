Measuring Resistance
====================

**Objective**

ExpEYES has a terminal marked **SEN**, that can be used for measuring
resistances in the range of :math:`100~\Omega` to :math:`100~k\Omega`. You can also study the
series and parallel combination of resistors. Effective resistance of a
series combination of resistors, :math:`R = R_1 + R_2 + ⋯`. For parallel
combination it is given by :math:`\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ⋯`

**Procedure**

-  Connect the resistor between SEN and any Ground terminal
-  Observe the value shown on the right side panel
-  Try series and parallel combinations
