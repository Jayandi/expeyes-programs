Human body as a conductor
=========================

**Objective**

Touching the AC mains is fatal to us because our body is a conductor. We
can explore this using low voltage signals.

**Procedure**

-  Set WG to 200 Hz.
-  Enable A1, A2 with analysis enabled.
-  Conenct WG and A1, with a wire
-  Connect WG and A2 through your body and note voltages
-  Repeat it using a 3 volt DC signal from PV1.

**Discussion**

The observed peak voltage will be less than 3volts, due to the
resistance of the body. There could be some ripple due to the 50Hz AC
pickup. This can be eliminated by performing the experiment far away
from power lines, using a laptop.
