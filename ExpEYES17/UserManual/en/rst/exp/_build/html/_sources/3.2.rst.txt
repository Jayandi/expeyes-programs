Fullwave rectifier using PN junctions
=====================================

**Objective**

Make a full wave rectifier, using two diodes. Two AC waveforms,
differing by 180 degree in phase as required. WG and WG bar provide the
same.

**Procedure**

-  Make connections
-  Enable A1, A2 and A3
-  Set WG to 200Hz and adjust timebase to view 4 to 5 cycles

**Discussion**

Adding capacitors to reduce the ripple is left as an exercise to the
user. This experiment is only to demonstrate the working of a full wave
rectifier, it cannot provide more than few milli amperes of current.

Why full-wave rectifier is superior to half-wave rectifier ?
