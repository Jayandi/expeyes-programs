of capacitors.

**Procedure**

-  Connect the capacitor between IN1 and Ground.
-  Click on “Capacitance on IN1” . Should not touch the capacitor while
   measuring
-  Repeat the measurement for Series and parallel combinations

**Discussion**

We have used :math:`100~pF` capacitors in this activity. For parallel
combination, the effective capacitance is given by :math:`C = C_1 + C_2 + ⋯`
, and for series combination by :math:`\frac{1}{C} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + ⋯`.
You can make the capacitors by pasting thin metal foils on both sides of
insulators like paper, polythene or glass.
