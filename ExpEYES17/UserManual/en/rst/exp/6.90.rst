Schematic
---------

- To Record Magnetic Hysterisis using a solenoid connected to PV1, and a MPU925x magnetometer connected to the I2C port.
  
Instructions
------------

- Connect the coil between PV1 and ground
- Connect the Magnetometer(MPU925x) to the I2C port
- Place the solenoid on top of the sensor such that the magnetic axis is perpendicular to the sensor
- Acquire data : This changes the PV1 voltage from -3 to 3 volts in 100 steps, and returns from 3V to -3V . This results in a proportional magnetic field generated by the solenoid which is also measured by the sensor and plotted
- Add a ferromagnetic material such as an alligator clip, and repeat the acquisition. Observe the hysteris for various different materials.
