UNTRANSLATED
Four-channel oscilloscope, and much more
========================================

  Eyes17 comes with an application whose default User Interface is an
  enhanced four-channel oscilloscope.


-  `Link to YouTube videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIHUjpPn9wf1aHElqLn1RJQ>`_

-  The Oscilloscope program mainly functions as a four channel
   oscilloscope, with inputs A1, A2, A3 and MIC.

-  Adjust the x-axis limit of the graph, using the Timebase Slider,
   generally to view several cycles of the waveform.

-  If the waveform is not stable, select the proper trigger source. If
   needed adjust the Trigger level.

-  The traces can be saved to a file, in text format. It is possible to
   take the Fourier transform and view the frequency spectrum of the
   input waveform.

-  The oscilloscope program also has control/monitor widgets on the
   right side panel to access most of the ExpEYES features.

-  The inputs A1, A2, A3 and the resistance connected to SEN are
   measured and displayed every second. But these readings are
   meaningless when AC inputs are connected.

-  For sinusoidal AC inputs, enable the Check-Button in front of the
   channel widget to view the Peak voltage and frequency.

-  The ExpEYES Input/Output terminals are briefly described below.

Output Terminals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **CCS:** :math:`1.1\ mA` Constant Current Source. On/Off using Check-Button
   Enable CCS.
-  **PV1:** Programmable Voltage, :math:`\pm 5\ V` range. Can be set using the
   Slider or Text-Entry widget
-  **PV2:** Similar to PV1, but ranges from :math:`- 3.3\ V` to :math:`+ 3.3\ V`
-  **SQ1:** Square Wave Generator, swings from :math:`0` to :math:`5\ V`.
   Frequency can be set from :math:`1\ Hz` to :math:`5\ kHz`.
-  **SQ2:** Same as SQ1, but available as an option of WG.
-  **OD1:** Digital Output, voltage can be set to :math:`0` or :math:`5\ V`.
-  **WG:** Waveform Generator. Frequency from :math:`1\ Hz` to :math:`5\ kHz`.
   Amplitude can be set to :math:`3\ V`, :math:`1\ V` or :math:`80\ mV`.
   Can be set to Sine, Triangular or Square.
   In Square mode the output is on SQ2, with :math:`0` to :math:`5\ V` swing.
-  **-WG:** Inverted output of WG

Input Terminals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	     

-  **IN1:** Input for measuring Capacitance. Push-Button provided for
   measurement.
-  **IN2:** Input for measuring frequency of digital signals, swinging
   between :math:`0` and :math:`3` to :math:`5\ V`.
   Push-Button provided for measurement.
-  **SEN:** Input for measuring resistance. This point is internally
   connected to :math:`3.3\ V` via a :math:`5.1\ k\Omega` resistor
-  **A1:** Voltage measurement point, functions as voltmeter and
   oscilloscope. Maximum Input range :math:`\pm\ 16\ V`, range is selectable
   from pull down menu. AC/DC mode selection by slider switch on the
   box.
-  **A2:** Same as A1, but no AC coupled mode
-  **A3:** Voltage measurement in :math:`\pm\ 3.3\ V`. Small signals can
   be amplified by connecting a resistance from Rg to Ground
-  **MIC:** Condenser microphone input, output appears as the fourth
   channel of the oscilloscope
-  **Rg:** Gain resistor for A3. :math:`Gain = 1 + \frac{R_{g}}{100}`.
   For example connecting a :math:`1\ k\Omega` resistor gives a gain of
   :math:`11`.
