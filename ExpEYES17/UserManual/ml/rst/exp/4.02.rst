XY plotting
===========

This program plots A1 vs A2 or (A1-A2) vs A2. It is useful for
plotting Lissajous figures and stdying RC circuits

For the circuit shown above, we can plot the voltage across the
capacitor against the voltage across the resistor. It will form a
circle when they are equal.

- Select C = 1uF, R = 1 kOhm and plot (A1-A2) vs A2. Adjust the frequency to get a circle
