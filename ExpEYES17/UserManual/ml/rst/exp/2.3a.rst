of capacitors.

**Procedure for two capacitors**

-  Connect one capacitor in IN1 and the second one in Ground. Connect the
   opposite ends of both capacitors together.
-  Click on “Capacitance on IN1” . Should not touch the capacitor while
   measuring

**Discussion**

For a series combination of capacitors, the effective capacitance is
given by the relation :math:`\frac{1}{C} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + ⋯`.
