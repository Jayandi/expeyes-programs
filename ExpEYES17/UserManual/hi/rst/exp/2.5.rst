**Procedure**

-  Connect the capacitor between IN1 and Ground.
-  Click on “Capacitance on IN1” . Should not touch the capacitor while
   measuring

**Discussion**

We have used :math:`100~pF` capacitors in this activity.

You can make the capacitors by pasting thin metal foils on both sides of
insulators like paper, polythene or glass.
