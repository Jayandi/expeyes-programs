**Procedure**

-  Connect a long wire to A3
-  Take one end of the wire near the AC mains line, without touching any

-  Enable A3, and itâ€™s analysis.

**Discussion**

The power line pickup is shown below, there are five cycles in 100
milliseconds. Without making any connection, how are we getting the AC
voltage from the mains supply ? Why the voltage increaes when you touch
the end of the wire connected to A1 by hand.
