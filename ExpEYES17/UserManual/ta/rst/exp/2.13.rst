Resistance of human body
========================

**Objective**

Measure the resistance of human body by comparing it with a known
resistor. We start with a DC input from PV1 and then using the AC signal
from WG.

**Procedure**

-  Set PV1 to 3 volts
-  Join PV1 and A2, through your body and measure voltage at A2
-  Calculate your body’s resistance, as given in section
   `2.4↑ <#sec:Measure-resistance-by-comparison>`__
-  Repeat using SINE instead of PV1. Enable analysis on A1 and A2 to
   measure voltage.

**Discussion**

The DC measurements are affected more by the electrical noise. The AC
resistance should be less than the DC resistance. The resistance is due
to our skin and AC can pass through this, like it passes through a
capacitor.
