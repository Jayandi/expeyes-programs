Before proceeding with the experiments, let us do some simple exercises
to become familiar with expEYES-Junior. Connect the device a USB port and
start the ExpEYES-Junior program from the menu ’Applications->Education’.
Enable the ’Popup Help’ option and select the first few items from the
school menu.

The following chapters are organized according to the pulldown menus of
the eyes junior program, each chapter containing the experiments under the
corresponding menu; like School level, Eelectronics, Eelectrical etc. To
