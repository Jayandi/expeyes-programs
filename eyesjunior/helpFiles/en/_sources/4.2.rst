XY plotting
===========

Objective
---------

Measure the amplitude and phase values in an RC circuit. The phase difference of voltages at
the two ends of the capacitor is given by

 :math:`\theta=\tan^{1}\Bigg(\frac{X_c}{R}\Bigg)` where the capacitive reactance :math:`X_c = \frac{1}{2\pi fC}`


Procedure
---------

-  Use a bread board as shown in the figure.
-  Fix a 1 µF capacitor and :math:`1k\Omega` resistor. 
-  Make the connections as shown in the schematic.

The resulting waveforms for the RC circuit are shown below. The green trace (voltage at A2) is the voltage waveform across the resistance. This can be considered as the current waveform since voltage and current are in phase across a resistance. The red trace is the voltage across the capacitance, and it can be seen that the current waveform is leading by 90 deg. 

The phase difference across the capacitor is diplayed at the top corner. This can be compared with the calculated values.
