You can run python code here to access the eyes17 hardware.
But this has restrictions, like the output to the console will
appear only in the end.
To run proper python programs to access eyes17, copy the directory
'/usr/share/doc/eyes17/examples' to the home directory to run the examples.
You should exit this GUI before that, the hardware can be accessed by only one
program at a time.
