Description: hardware & software framework for developing science experiments
 This package provides high level interfaces for making science experiments
 with an ExpEYES box.
 .
 ExpEYES is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
 Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for
 developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
 science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
 measurements and analysing the data in different ways. Analog
 voltages are measured with 0.025% resolution and time intervals with
 one microsecond. This project is based on Free and Open Source
 software, mostly written in Python programming language. The hardware
 design is also open.

Description: hardware & software framework for developing science experiments
 This package provides high level interfaces for making science experiments
 with an ExpEYES-17 box.
 .
 ExpEYES-17 is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
 Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for
 developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
 science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
 measurements and analysing the data in different ways. When compared with
 previous ExpEYES boxes (Expeyes, Expeyes-Junior), ExpEYES-17 is richer
 in various features: multiple soft input ranges, more flexible wave
 generator, better time resolution, better voltage resolution, supports
 seamlessly cheap I2C sensors.

Description: hardware & software framework to learn microcontrollers
 This package provides a set of example programs to drive an ATmega32
 microcontroller, together with a tutorial explaining how to compile
 them, upload them to the microcontroller, and how to make simple and
 more complicated modifications. It is meant to be used with the
 "microhope" board which makes it easy to upload code to the microcontroller
 through a USB link.
 .
 In addition to examples there is a library to drive all of the peripherals
 available on the "microhope" board: LED, LCD display, ADC connected to
 sensors.
 .
 A Graphic User Interface is provided too.
